## Setting Up Your First Site

Before you can begin using Forestry’s CMS, you need to first import a site built using Jekyll or Hugo for us to build your custom CMS around.

If you don’t have a site already, don’t worry! We have options for importing example sites, as well as a "demo" site to get you started.

## Create your account

If you haven’t already, [create your Forestry account](https://app.forestry.io/signup). Upon signing up, you will be presented with options for setting up your first site.

## Importing from a Git Repository

The best way to get started with Forestry is to import your own Jekyll or Hugo site from an existing Git Repository.

**Importing your site from Git means:**

* When you make changes in the CMS, we’ll commit them back to the repository. This means *free backups*!
* Developers can continue to work in their environment, and as changes are pushed to Git we’ll update the CMS to reflect this.
* You’ll own all of your content in your repository. 

*We believe giving you ownership of your content is really important.*

## Importing from zip

Another option for getting started with Forestry is uploading a zip archive of your entire project.

**Importing your site with a Zip file means:**

* When you make changes in the CMS, we store them on our server. This means *no backups*.
* Developers can continue to develop the theme, but they must re-import the site in zip format each time.
* You still own your content, as we allow you to download your updated source code at any time. See [backups for more information](/docs/deployment-and-management/backups)

## Importing the demo

The final option is importing a Forestry demo site. This is a fully-functioning demo that can be set up to deploy to an external location, and allows you to preview all of the functionality of Forestry.
