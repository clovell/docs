Forestry is a modern CMS (content management system) for websites. It powers websites of all sizes from portfolios to blogs, marketing websites, eCommerce sites, and enterprise websites.

## Why Choose Forestry Over Something Else?
Forestry powers sites built using *static site generators*. This is important because Static Sites --- the sites a static site generator creates --- are much faster and performant, are more mobile-friendly, and so much easier to maintain.

Existing solutions like Wordpress are *not* static, they are what we call *dynamic*. Dynamic sites work much differently, and are not suitable for most websites. 

A great example is as follows: imagine every time you went to the library and asked to borrow a book, they had to go to the computer, get the content, print every single page, glue the pages to the binding, and illustrate the cover of the book. *That would take a long time.*

Every page a visitor requests from a dynamic site requires essentially the same process, whereas a static site is like a regular library. The site has already been made, we just need to give it to you.

Unless you have a site with drastically different content for every visitor (for example, [Amazon][1]), a dynamic site is simply overkill.

Thatâ€™s where Forestry comes in. You get to manage your content with a great CMS, your developers build a static site, and your visitors get an extremely fast and performant website!

## Managing Content
Forestry creates a custom CMS specific to your site, and provides an interface for editing your content that is both familiar and innovative.

We have an [in-depth guide to editing content with Forestry][2].
