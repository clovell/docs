## A GUI for non-devs
Saving changes from your Forestry CMS will:

* Commit changes to a repo (optional)
* Compile & deploy to your host (optional)

## Continue to use Git
If you use GitHub or Bitbucket, Forestry will watch your repo for changes and pull them in so you can push code while your editors are using the CMS.

Devs can work locally while non-devs use the Forestry CMS. See all of your Forestry content edits in your commit history.

## Deploy anywhere
Forestry is host-agnostic. Everytime an update is made via your CMS, Forestry will compile your site and deploy it to your host (S3, GitHub Pages, FTP, etc).

## Markdown, HTML and WYSIWYG 
Editors can switch between Markdown, HTML and WYSIWYG editing.

## Zero setup time
No configuration needed. Just upload your site and Forestry will automatically build your CMS in seconds.

## A hosted CMS
Forestry is a hosted CMS. No need to install or maintain any bloated software.

## Don't lock to a CMS
No configuration and you're not locked into hosting. Forestry is a GUI that doesn't interfere with your site.
