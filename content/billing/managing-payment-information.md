Payment information for an account is managed from `Account Settings`.

Account Settings can be accessed from two locations:

* From the dashboard, located in the top right <img src="/docs/assets/images/billing_account_dropdown.png" alt="Dashboard Dropdown" draggable="true" data-bukket-ext-bukket-draggable="true">

* From a site, located the bottom left of the sidebarÂ <img src="/docs/assets/images/billing_account_menu.png" alt="Admin Menu" draggable="true" data-bukket-ext-bukket-draggable="true">

## Managing Your Payment Information

From the account management page, your payment information can be managed on the `Cards` tab.
