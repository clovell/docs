Forestry allows you to edit old_menus for your Hugo site. To access this feature, navigate to the “Menus” tab on the left side of the screen.

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">From here you can re-order old_menus by clicking and dragging the old_menu items.</span>

<span style="letter-spacing: 0.01em;">You are able to set the link to an internal page on your site, or an external link, by selecting the relevant tab in the modal.</span>  

You can add news links by clicking the “Add Link” button at the top of the list. After clicking, a modal will appear that will allow you to configure the old_menu item.
