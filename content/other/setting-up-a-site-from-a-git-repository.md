## Importing from a repo
If you import your site from a repository, Forestry will commit all content changes back to that repo.  Finally, all of your content updates will be in version control!

### Deploying your site
If you want Forestry to build and deploy your site (Amazon S3, GitHub Pages, FTP, etc), you can also set up hosting. Input your hosting information and when someone clicks "publish" in Forestry, their changes will be committed to your repo AND the site will be built and deployed to your host. 

### Working locally 
Just <code>git pull</code> and work on your site locally. Forestry will watch your repo for changes

### Auto-deploy
If you enable auto-deploy in Site Settings, Forestry will automatically deploy your site every time you push code to your repository.
