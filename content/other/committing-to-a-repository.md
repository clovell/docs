title: Committing to a repository
---

If during your initial setup, you chose a git repository as your source, whenever you click Publish (or Save Draft) one of the things Forestry will do is create a commit to the repository you chose as your source. This will be done in addition to publishing your site to your prefered hosting method.

You may notice some small changes to your code that you weren't expecting. These changes are necessary for Forestry to be able to read and manage your site. You can read about what changes forestry will make [here](/faq-what-changes-will-forestry-make-to-my-repository-md).
