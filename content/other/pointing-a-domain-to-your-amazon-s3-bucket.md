## What is DNS?
The Domain Name System (DNS) is often a headache for the noob developers.   The purpose of DNS is to associate a readable domain name, like *forestry.io* with it's corresponding IP addresses.

## Set up name servers on
* Go to Amazon's [Route 53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/)
* Click on **Hosted Zones** then **Create Hosted Zone**.  Your domain name should be the same as your bucket name (I don't think this is mandatory, but it just keeps things simple).

* Route 53 will generate name servers. You need copy these over to your domain registrar (where you purchased your domain: Godaddy, Name.com, etc). Here I'm using Name.com

Now go to your registrar and input your new name servers (remove the old ones too).

* When you copy the name servers over, be sure to **not include** the last dot-character
## Create an A-record

* Now, go back to Route 53 and create an A-record by clicking **Create Record Set** then choose **Alias** and select the appropriate bucket after they load (takes a few seconds).

## Redirect your WWW subdomain to your bucket
If you want your *www* subdomain to redirect to your bucket, add a new records set for that too. Click **Create Record Set** and add *www* to your domain, select **Alias** and type your bucket name with a dot at the end.
