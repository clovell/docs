## Importing from a zip 

If you choose to upload a zip file, the maximum file size that we support is 250MB (note, if you import your site from a repo, there is no maximum file size).

### Deploying your site
If you set up your hosting credentials, all content changes through Forestry will be built and deployed to your host.

### Working locally 
If you need to work on your site after some content editors have made some changes, you will need to download a backup from your Forestry dashboard. The backup will contain your entire Jekyll/Hugo project with all of the new content changes.  When you're done. Just  zip it up again and re-upload.
