**Download** Download the single CMS file (it's just an `index.html` file).

**For Hugo sites**  
Put the CMS file in an `admin` folder in the `static` directory of your Hugo project. Like so: `static/admin/index.html`.

**For Jekyll sites**  
Put the CMS file in an `admin` folder in the root directory of your Jekyll project. Like so: `/admin/index.html`.

**Deploy**  
Build and deploy your site as you normally would, then visit the admin folder in your browser (`mysite.com/admin/`).

Like WordPress without the crap ;)
