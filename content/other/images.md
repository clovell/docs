Images may be added to posts directly in the main content body or through front matter fields. 

## Markdown Editor

To add an image to the markdown editor, simply click the "Add Image" button:

[ Image: Markdown editor, image button highlighted]

A modal will pop up where you can either upload a new image or select one that you've already uploaded.

The image will be inserted into the editor like so:

`[](path/to/image)`

You can move the image by changing the location of this text. You can also supply alternative text (in case the image is unavailable) like so:

`[alternative text](path/to/image)`

Supplying this alternate text is also important for things like screen readers, as well as search engine ranking.

You are also able to use the image as a link with the following example:

`[![alt text](path/to/image)](/some/link/)`

## WYSIWYG

To add an image in the content body, click on the "Image" button on the top of the editor, and select the image you would like to add.

A modal will appear that will allow you to upload a new image, or select on that you've already uploaded:

In the WYSIWYG editor, the image is actually inserted into the editor.

Clicking on the image opens up a modal that allows you to change various settings on the image.

- Title: Will serve as the alternative text
- Link: If supplied, clicking on the image will act as a link
- Open in new tab: Should the link open in a new tab

## Front matter

Adding an image to the front matter is very easy.

- Select an image
