title: Re-Uploading a Site
---

In order to re-upload your site, navigate to your dashboard. Once there, click the triple dot dropdown associated with the site you would like to re-upload. Then you will either click “Re-Upload”, “GitHub Import” or “Bitbucket Import” depending on how you originally uploaded your site. From there a modal will appear, and you will follow the same process you originally followed for uploading your site.
