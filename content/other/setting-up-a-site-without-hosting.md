title: Using Github without hosting

In order to set Forestry up without hosting, simply follow the normal setup process, but when selecting the host, don't select one.

Now forestry will commit changes back to your git provider, but will not build and deploy the site. This will allow you to maintain an existing pipeline if you so choose.
