You can add users to specific sites in Forestry. If you give someone access to your site, Forestry will send them an email with instructions on setting up their account. To add a user, click the settings old_menu next to your site name.

You can give them specific level of access:

* **Editor** - Can edit the site's content.
* **Site Manager** - Everything the editor can do, plus manage the site's plan, add/remove team members, and download backups.
* **Developer** - Everything the site manager can do, plus managing site settings and Front Matter Templates
* **Owner** - Everything a developer can do, plus the ability to delete the site.
