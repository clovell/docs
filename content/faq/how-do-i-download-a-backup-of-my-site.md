title: How do I download a backup of my site?

<img src="/docs/forestryio/images/download-backup-forestry.png" alt="Forestry download backup of site" class="small right">From your dashboard click the more menu by your site and select "download"

If your site is linked to a Git repo, you will get the most recent backup from that repo.
