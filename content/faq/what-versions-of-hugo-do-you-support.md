title: What versions of Hugo do you support?
---

Forestry always supports the previous 3 major versions of Hugo with their latest patch. (e.g, x.3.x, x.2.x, x.1.x).

Backwards compatibility is always available for sites using an older version of Hugo that was supported when the site was added to Forestry.

**Note:**Â Forestry does not provide immediate support for Hugo releases.
