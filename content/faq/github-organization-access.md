title: Why do I have to allow access to my GitHub organization?
---

Unfortunately this is the only way GitHub handles permissions currently.  If your organization has enabled 3rd party applications, you'll see that message when authenticating.  If you're the owner of the GitHub organization you can disable 3rd-party applications.  If you don't want some of your repos to be accessible by 3rd-party applications (such as Slack, Forestry, etc), you would have to create a second GitHub organization where you don't enable 3rd-party access and move your repo to that account.
