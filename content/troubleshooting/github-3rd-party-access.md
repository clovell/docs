Are you getting this error message? 

><i> You don't seem to have administrative access to any repositories. You will need administrative access so that we can add a webhook to your repository to keep Forestry.io in sync with your code.</i>

If you can't access your repos after authenticating with GitHub, ensure that you have 3rd-party access enabled:
