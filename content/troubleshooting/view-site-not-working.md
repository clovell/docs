The `View Site` button opens a new tab of the live version of your site, and is located in the sidebar. It can be configured with the `Site URL` setting, located in `Settings` under the `General` tab.

If this isn’t working, this means your live site hasn't been set up correctly. There are many reasons this could be the case.

Some of the common reasons are:

* The Site URL​ setting isn't the right URL. *This setting is case-sensitive, so be sure you don't have case issues.*
* You haven’t set up <a href="https://app.forestry.io/docs/deployment-and-management/setting-up-deployment" style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">deployment</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">.</span>

* Your <a href="/docs/pointing-a-domain-to-your-amazon-s3-bucket/" style="font-size: 1rem; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">domain</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;isn't set up to point to your hosting provider.</span>
