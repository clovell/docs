Data files are pieces of content that donâ€™t belong to a specific page or piece of content. They are commonly used for managing content like social media handles and links, contact information, and branding (*e.g, logo images and site colours*). You can find these under *"data"* in your CMS.

The editing interface for data files is very similar to the front matter interface for the [content editor](/docs/managing-content/editing-content).
