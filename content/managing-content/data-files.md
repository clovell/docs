title: Data Files
---

Data files are pieces of content that donâ€™t belong to a specific page or piece of content. They are commonly used for managing content like social media handles and links, contact information, and branding (*e.g, logo images and site colours*). You can find these under *"data"* in your CMS.

The editing interface for data files is very similar to the front matter interface for the [content editor](/docs/managing-content/editing-content).

## Customizing The Editing Interface

The interface for data files is auto-generated at the time of import. The interface can be customized on a per-field basis by clicking the the settings icon beside the field name.

A modal will open allowing you to select field type you desire.
