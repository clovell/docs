Forestry allows you to manage all of your different types of content. These are separate pages in your CMS that allow you to view all of your drafted and published [content](/docs/managing-content/editing-content) for that type of content. You can find these under *"content"* in the sidebar of your CMS.

## Managing your content
Forestry allows you to manage and edit your content from these list views.

We allow you to:

* Add new content
* Delete content
* Edit existing content
* Publish content
* Unpublish content (set them as drafts)
* Search your content

**Note:** depending on your site configuration, some published pages may not appear in your built site if the date field is set in the future. For more information, see [Jekyll’s](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/) or [Hugo’s](https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart#step-3-add-content) docs on drafts.

## Searching content
Forestry allows you to search for specific pieces of content by name. When searching, you will only receive results for the content type you are currently viewing.
