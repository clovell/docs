title: Deploying your site with FTP
---

If you are hosting your static site on an FTP server, you should be aware that Forestry will delete all files from your destination directory before Â writing the new, updated files.

This could be problematic if you keep non-website related files in your FTP account. &nbsp;If you don't want Forestry to empty all of your files, consider setting up your site in a clean subdirectory. &nbsp;To do so, see the advanced options when setting up your hosting credentials.
