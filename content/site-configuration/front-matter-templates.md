In static sites, front matter (or “fields”) for pages can be added to the top of the content file. This front matter can then be used to customize the content, appearance, and layout of your site.

Front Matter Templates allow you to control what data is displayed in the CMS, allowing you to provide file uploads, image galleries, and rich text editors to content editors. Front Matter templates also effect how this data is saved in your content files. 

Front matter templates can be accessed from the sidebar under `Front Matter` by users with the `developer` role or higher.

The configuration for Front Matter Templates is stored in your site’s source at `/.forestryio/front_matter/templates/` in individual YAML files. See [Config Files](/site-configuration/config-files#front-matter-templates) for more information.

## Creating Front Matter Templates
Front Matter Templates can be created from scratch, or can be created using the fields from an existing page without a Front Matter Template.

To create a Front Matter Template from scratch, go to the `Front Matter` section found in the sidebar, and click `Add Template` in the page toolbar.

To create a Front Matter Template from an an existing page without a Front Matter Template, navigate to the page you want to use and click the `...` button in the page’s toolbar. In options dropdown, click `Create Template`.

![Add Template From Page](/docs/assets/images/front-matter-from-page.jpg)

In the modal that opens, click `Create Template`. This will create the new template and redirect you to the Front Matter Template editor.

## Applying to Content
Front Matter Templates can be applied to all content in a Jekyll collection or Hugo section, as well as to individual pages.

Applying or changing a Front Matter Template follows a “no modification” rule, it will not remove or modify values that already exist in your content files.

## Section & Collection Defaults
To apply a Front Matter Template to an entire section or collection, you must edit the section or collection defaults in the `settings.yml` configuration file. See [Config Files](/site-configuration/config-files#front-matter-templates) for more information.

## Page Templates
To apply a Front Matter Template to a single page, navigate to the page you want to apply the Front Matter Template to, and click the `...` button in the page’s toolbar. In options dropdown, click `Change Template`

![Change Template](/docs/assets/images/front-matter-change-template.jpg)

In the modal that opens select the Front Matter Template you wish to be applied to the page from the dropdown.

## Autogenerated Front Matter Templates
When importing a new site, Forestry will attempt to generate a Front Matter Template using either Jekyll’s [Front Matter Defaults](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults) or [Hugo Archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content/archetypes/). To prevent conflicts, Forestry does not synchronize Front Matter Templates and defaults when changes are made to either.

**Note:** as of Hugo 0.24, Archetypes can now be built as GoTemplates. Forestry does not support GoTemplates in Front Matter Templates, and will ignore these templates, or treat the default values as strings.

## Field Types
You can customize the way front matter fields appear by using different field types.

All fields share some common options:

* The **label** that editors will see in the editor
* The **name** or key of the field, used in front matter and templates
* The **description**, which is help text that appears above the field in the editor

![Common Front Matter Options](/docs/assets/images/General%20Options.jpg)

See the [full list of field types](/docs/front-matter-fields/).

### Field Defaults
A default value can be entered in the preview of a Front Matter Field when editing a template. 

Defaults are used when creating new pages. Setting a field default or changing a field default will not change the value for existing content.

### Removing Fields
Removing fields from a Front Matter Template does not remove the associated data from existing pages using that Front Matter Template. However, the removed field will no longer be visible within the content editor.
