Forestry allows users to white-label their custom CMS by uploading their own logo in the site settings. This is great for freelancers or businesses that want to provide their customers with a powerful CMS for their Static Site while maintaining their own business branding.

## White-label Standards
In order to get the best results from your white-labelling, there are some standards you should follow to ensure the CMS looks the best it can.

**Logo Standards**

* Upload a logo with a transparent background, with bright colors. Preferably white.
* Upload a logo with the dimensions of 300 wide x 57 high.

## Uploading a Logo
To add your own logo to your CMS, you can do the following:

1. Go to the `Settings` section of your siteâ€™s CMS
2. Find the `Logo` option for your site
3. Drag & drop your logo image onto the drop zone or click to select a file to upload
4. Save your site settings
